                    <p>
                        Americans have adapted uniforms into costumes since the
                        masquerade balls of colonial days to today’s historical films
                        and battle reenactments. The practice took an unexpected form
                        in the first decades following the American Revolution when the
                        early presses of the United States closely covered imperial
                        insurrections that unfolded across Islamicate societies against
                        the three towering empires of the era: the Greek War of
                        Independence against the Ottomans (1821–29), the Ottoman
                        Algerian resistance to the French (1830–48), and the Indian
                        uprising against the British (1857). Alongside depictions of
                        these struggles, American popular media paid careful attention
                        to the “national” dress and military uniforms that could
                        potentially unify a revolution or even aid in controlling
                        insurrection. As the young nation navigated its connections to
                        the Islamicate world, some reinterpreted visual and sartorial
                        modes of imperial resistance. The reverberations of these
                        events led to the emergence of orientalist costumes and dress
                        that transformed regional revolutionary garb into American
                        fashion statements of solidarity, fascination, and emulation. 
                        <br>
                        Through these forms of cosmopolitan materialism, Americans
                        announced their political stances on historic movements,
                        sometimes also asserting their country’s imperial ambitions and
                        legacies as it solidified its standing in the world. Such
                        sartorial translations from uniforms to fashion informed
                        America’s evolving relationship with its own revolutionary
                        past. Each medium these costumes inhabited aided Americans in
                        creatively redefining their country’s transforming identity on
                        the international stage while facing resonant issues in their
                        new nation, including foreign trade, slavery, and
                        humanitarianism. Alongside contextualizing documents, the works
                        here vividly illustrate how the U.S. wielded these movements of
                        imperial insurrection to remold its own world image and don it
                        with aplomb.

                <p>The visual histories of Algeria leading up to the
French invasion of 1830 illustrate the blurred line
between the concepts of custom and costume in the
premodern world. In the Algerian Regency before 1830,
the dey, the local head of government elected by
Janissary officers, ruled over this Ottoman-controlled
region. Meanwhile, beys governed the three
sub-provinces of Constantine, Oran, and Titteri under
the dey’s authority. To receive imperial investiture
as a new bey or dey, a senior official from the
regency submitted his application with an array of
gifts in person before the Sublime Porte, or central
government, in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople.
The Ottomans then sent their own official (kapıcı) to
the regency to confirm the investiture in a lavish
ceremony, during which the dey would receive robes of
honor and a sultanic gift, such as a gem-encrusted
dagger or sword. Just as these sartorially infused
traditions defined rulership on the Barbary Coast,
foreigners also merged custom and costume to document
all they learned about their formidable Mediterranean
adversaries. After 1830, the French would also use
costume and uniform to assert their power over these
colonized peoples.</p>
