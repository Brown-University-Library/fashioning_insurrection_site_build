                    <p>
                        Americans have adapted uniforms into costumes since the
                        masquerade balls of colonial days to today’s historical films
                        and battle reenactments. The practice took an unexpected form
                        in the first decades following the American Revolution when the
                        early presses of the United States closely covered imperial
                        insurrections that unfolded across Islamicate societies against
                        the three towering empires of the era: the Greek War of
                        Independence against the Ottomans (1821–29), the Ottoman
                        Algerian resistance to the French (1830–48), and the Indian
                        uprising against the British (1857). Alongside depictions of
                        these struggles, American popular media paid careful attention
                        to the “national” dress and military uniforms that could
                        potentially unify a revolution or even aid in controlling
                        insurrection. As the young nation navigated its connections to
                        the Islamicate world, some reinterpreted visual and sartorial
                        modes of imperial resistance. The reverberations of these
                        events led to the emergence of orientalist costumes and dress
                        that transformed regional revolutionary garb into American
                        fashion statements of solidarity, fascination, and emulation. 
                        <br>
                        Through these forms of cosmopolitan materialism, Americans
                        announced their political stances on historic movements,
                        sometimes also asserting their country’s imperial ambitions and
                        legacies as it solidified its standing in the world. Such
                        sartorial translations from uniforms to fashion informed
                        America’s evolving relationship with its own revolutionary
                        past. Each medium these costumes inhabited aided Americans in
                        creatively redefining their country’s transforming identity on
                        the international stage while facing resonant issues in their
                        new nation, including foreign trade, slavery, and
                        humanitarianism. Alongside contextualizing documents, the works
                        here vividly illustrate how the U.S. wielded these movements of
                        imperial insurrection to remold its own world image and don it
                        with aplomb.

        <h2>Philhellenism: Americans in Support of the Greek Revolution and in Greek Costume</h2>
        <div id="casedescription">
            <p>
                <p>Costume permeated the international discourse
regarding the Greek War of Independence, particularly
in America. Although the U.S. government refused to
become directly involved in the Greek struggle,
Americans volunteered to fight alongside Greek rebels.
Those supporters who remained at home took it upon
themselves to raise funds and awareness about the
revolution. The most memorable way they found to
embody their solidarity was to wear Greek folk dress
for portraits and costume balls. National garb also
marked one way that the new Bavarian ruler of Greece
unsuccessfully attempted to relate to his new
subjects. Greek costumes also became distinguishing
elements in the polarizing satirical cartoons and
propaganda that circulated through regions and states
during the conflict.</p>
