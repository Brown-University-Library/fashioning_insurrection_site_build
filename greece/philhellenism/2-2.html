              <h2>About the exhibit</h2>
              <p>
              Americans have adapted uniforms into costumes since the
              masquerade balls of colonial days to today’s historical films
              and battle reenactments. The practice took an unexpected form
              in the first decades following the American Revolution when the
              early presses of the United States closely covered imperial
              insurrections that unfolded across Islamicate societies against
              the three towering empires of the era: the Greek War of
              Independence against the Ottomans (1821–29), the Ottoman
              Algerian resistance to the French (1830–48), and the Indian
              uprising against the British (1857). Alongside depictions of
              these struggles, American popular media paid careful attention
              to the “national” dress and military uniforms that could
              potentially unify a revolution or even aid in controlling
              insurrection. As the young nation navigated its connections to
              the Islamicate world, some reinterpreted visual and sartorial
              modes of imperial resistance. The reverberations of these
              events led to the emergence of orientalist costumes and dress
              that transformed regional revolutionary garb into American
              fashion statements of solidarity, fascination, and emulation. 
              <br>
              Through these forms of cosmopolitan materialism, Americans
              announced their political stances on historic movements,
              sometimes also asserting their country’s imperial ambitions and
              legacies as it solidified its standing in the world. Such
              sartorial translations from uniforms to fashion informed
              America’s evolving relationship with its own revolutionary
              past. Each medium these costumes inhabited aided Americans in
              creatively redefining their country’s transforming identity on
              the international stage while facing resonant issues in their
              new nation, including foreign trade, slavery, and
              humanitarianism. Alongside contextualizing documents, the works
              here vividly illustrate how the U.S. wielded these movements of
              imperial insurrection to remold its own world image and don it
              with aplomb.
